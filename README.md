## 🔍 Problem Statement

Agricultural production is highly dependent on several dynamic factors like area harvested, crop yield, and environmental changes. Accurate predictions of crop production can help in:
- Efficient resource planning
- Food security initiatives
- Crop planning strategies

However, predicting production accurately from historical data in an interactive and accessible way remains a challenge.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Transform raw FAOSTAT data into meaningful features
- Visualize production trends and patterns
- Build a predictive model using machine learning
- Create an interactive web application using Streamlit

## 💡 Solution Overview

FarmIQ is built to perform three key functions:
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Transforms messy agricultural data into usable form.
2. Visualization:** Displays area-wise and crop-wise patterns, correlations, and time series trends.
3. Prediction Engine:** Uses Linear Regression and Random Forest models to forecast production values based on yield, harvested area, and year.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

### Features Used:
- `Area harvested`
- `Yield`
- `Year`

### Target:
- `Production`

### Algorithms Implemented:
